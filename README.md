So you've painstakingly built a design for your site/application. You have created the PSD files and even printed out the PDF booklet and handed it to the developer. Your work is done, right? Nope. A few rounds of meetings with the developer is in your future. Inserting "Pattern Lab" into the flow can help. Pattern Lab along with "Atomic Design" not only can help in opening a dialog channel between the developer and the designer but also can help in future changes and enhancements.
